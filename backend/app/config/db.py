"""
Database engine and session management.

Provides the async SQLAlchemy engine, the async session factory, and
session-acquisition helpers for both Litestar request handling and
out-of-request contexts (RQ workers, scripts). This module is
intentionally framework-agnostic — it does not import Litestar — so the
same engine/session machinery can be reused by background workers.
